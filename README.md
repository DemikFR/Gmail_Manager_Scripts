<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Noticing that my Gmail inbox had a lot of things, some of which were not even read, I decided to look for a way to delete them all together without the need to select one by one (How long would it take?).

After seeing some articles, I had seen that I could do it through Python and its Imaplib library, which serves precisely to connect to the Gmail API. Since I'm studying Python and there was this need to use it, why not?

I separated 3 Jupyter Notebook scripts (You need to run them in this order):
* <strong>get_email_data</strong>: This script is for connecting and fetching email data such as sender, subject and message. Additionally, it treats this data and places it in a CSV file. 
* <strong>analysis_my_gmail</strong>: As the name implies, it will do a little analysis with some graphs for interpretation.
* <strong>delete_emails</strong>: Here, the e-mails will be deleted according to the selected senders.

As you can see, a process was followed which will be explained part by part according to the next topics.



## Built With

This project, in addition to being written in Python, used some of its libraries.



* [![Gmail][Gmail.com]][Gmail-url]
* [![Python][Python.py]][Python-url]
* [![Jupyter][Jupyter.ipynb]][Jupyter-url]
* [![Matplotlib][Matplotlib.py]][Matplotlib-url]
* [![Pandas][Pandas.py]][Pandas-url]

In addition to these you will have to use the wordcloud <b>lib</b>, <b>yaml</b> <b>imaplib</b>, <b>email</b> and <b>concurrent.futures</b>




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In addition to installing the libraries as per the prerequisites subtopic below, you will need to enable IMAP in your Gmail and generate an app password, all shown below.



### Prerequisites

Fisrt of all you will need to activate the IMAP and create your APP password:

1. Settings

2. See all settings

3. Fowarding and POP/IMAP

4. At the last, enable the IMAP

[![IMAP][IMAP-Print]]

5. Access [Google account](https://myaccount.google.com/)

6. Security

7. App password

8. Save the password in a safe place



### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DemikFR/Gmail_Manager_Scripts.git
   ```
2. Open the 'credentials.yaml' to enter your previously generated email and password
   ```yaml
    user : "Your email"
    password : "Your password"
   ```

Now, you will be able to use this project to verify your emails on a large scale, in the next topic you will be able to understand how the scripts work.
