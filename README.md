<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Noticing that my Gmail inbox had a lot of things, some of which were not even read, I decided to look for a way to delete them all together without the need to select one by one (How long would it take?).

After seeing some articles, I had seen that I could do it through Python and its Imaplib library, which serves precisely to connect to the Gmail API. Since I'm studying Python and there was this need to use it, why not?

I separated 3 Jupyter Notebook scripts (You need to run them in this order):
* <strong>get_email_data</strong>: This script is for connecting and fetching email data such as sender, subject and message. Additionally, it treats this data and places it in a CSV file. 
* <strong>analysis_my_gmail</strong>: As the name implies, it will do a little analysis with some graphs for interpretation.
* <strong>delete_emails</strong>: Here, the e-mails will be deleted according to the selected senders.

As you can see, a process was followed which will be explained part by part according to the next topics.



## Built With

This project, in addition to being written in Python, used some of its libraries.
